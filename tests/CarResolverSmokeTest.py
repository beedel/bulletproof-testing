"""
This is an additional test class for CarResolver.

This test uses the original CarRepository class instead of replacing it with a mock,
which makes it an integration/smoke test.

This is done to ensure that, for example, if the SQL code in CarRepository is changed,
it still works. If we did not have this test, we may encounter a situation where vital
application functionality is down because of some unaccounted changes in the source code.

Try to fill out the TODOs to get the test to run.
